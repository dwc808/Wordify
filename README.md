# Wordify

# About this project

This is a simple browser based word game. Each day, the game has a new starting word. The player's goal is to make a new word by changing, removing, or adding one letter. Then the process repeats on this new word - the user may play 12 words. The longer the word, the more points the player receives. The word list for the game was created by filtering the unix-words list with Python scripts to remove proper nouns and words with only one or two letters, and then converting the list into a JSON friendly dictionary.

# Work in progress

- Continue to tweak CSS to improve responsiveness and add animations to make flow of play more clear.
- Add media query to improve mobile layout
- Host game and setup daily word schedule
- Make scores shareable via social media
